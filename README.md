## Getting Started

<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

You’ll need to have Node 14.0.0 or later version on your local development machine (but it’s not required on the server). We recommend using the latest LTS version. You can use nvm (macOS/Linux) or nvm-windows to switch Node versions between different projects.
